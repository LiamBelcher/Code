# GHS ROVER PROJCET
# What I am doing is design in a drone frame this drone frame will be 3d printed with a 3d printer I am following a guide on the internet on how to design it on fusion 360 I am planning on using this drone for looking at the trees to make sure that they are not being threatened by wildlife or by nature (dehydration). The drone will have a camera that will beagle to rotate in all directions so we can see as many plants as we possibly can in only 1 frame I am also thinking about possibly putting an infrared camera on it to see if the ground is dry and needs water in it for the trees to grow and not shrivel up and die. The drone will be remote-controlled by a pilot on the ground with a screen so they can see what the drone sees through the camera.
